The aim of the "Askia Design eXtensions":https://github.com/AskiaADX is to provide an easy way to fully customise Askia-generated outputs. They're an extension Askia's rendering engine.

Technically, it's just a @.zip@ file that encapsulates the awesome page template or control designed by Mr. NitPick while allowing Mr. Noob to tune the final display using a simple user interface.

* The ADP defined the global layout of the survey page(s).
* The ADC defined the layout of the control to answer.

In few words, ADX provides a lot of flexibility for people who are web literate and keeps its simple stupid for people who are not as comfortable with web technologies.

Moreover, Askia doesn't take anymore the responsibility to hurt the Mr. Droopy's sensibility with suspicious code.
